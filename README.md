# Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project focuses on building a deep learningâ€“based **real-time object detection system** for autonomous vehicles. The goal is to reliably detect and classify key objects on the road. Such as pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles, to support safe navigation under diverse environmental conditions.

The model will be trained on publicly available autonomous driving datasets and deployed via a lightweight web interface that can process live video streams and display bounding boxes for detected objects in real time.

## ðŸš€ Phases
- **Data Preparation:** Image preprocessing and annotation formatting.
- **EDA & Feature Engineering:** Class distribution analysis and data augmentation.
- **Model Training & Validation:** Training models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or SSD, with evaluation using mAP (mean Average Precision) and FPS (inference speed).
- **Deployment:** A demo web app for real-time video input detection with bounding boxes.

## âœ… Deliverables
- A trained object detection model with evaluation metrics (accuracy, mAP, FPS).
- A short report summarizing model performance.
- A demo application showcasing real-time object detection on video streams.
